## Data Science Tools:
1. Jupyter Notebooks:
   - Description: Interactive computing environment that allows creating and sharing documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
   
2. VS Code (Visual Studio Code):
   - Description: A lightweight, extensible code editor with built-in support for Python and various extensions for data science tasks, including debugging, linting, and version control integration.

3. RStudio:
   - Description: An integrated development environment (IDE) for R, providing a user-friendly interface for data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling with the R programming language.


## Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python


```python
# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
(3*4)+5
```

```python
# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
minutes = 200
hours = minutes/60
print(hours)
```
